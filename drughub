DRUGHUB LINK | DRUGHUB MARKET | DRUGHUB URL

ACCESSING DRUGHUB
[Captcha]
DrugHub implements a robust access system to enhance security and prevent phishing and DDoS attacks. Each user on the platform is assigned a unique access .onion address. To obtain this address, users need to visit a LDN (Link Directory Node) on either https://drughub.su or http://drughubb7lmqymhpq24wmhihloii3dlp3xlqhz356dqdvhmkv2ngf4id.onion

Once on the LDN page, users will need to complete a CAPTCHA and press a button to generate a new mirror. The generated mirror is signed and should always be verified against the platform's PGP key to ensure its authenticity.

Importantly, the assigned mirror is tied to each user individually, meaning only the user can access it. This adds an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access.

Vendors, on the other hand, are assigned Permanent Mirrors. These mirrors are exclusively accessible by vendors and users who have established transactions on the marketplace. This eliminates the need for vendors and qualified users to fetch a new URL for each interaction, streamlining the process.

CAPTCHA
[Captcha]
Upon accessing DrugHub, users will encounter a Captcha challenge designed to verify their human identity. Within this challenge, a transparent circle will be displayed, allowing users to view the underlying layer. The task at hand involves aligning the top circle layer with the bottom layer before the Captcha timeout bar is completely depleted. Subsequently, users may proceed by clicking the continue button in order to gain access to the marketplace.

Located at the top of the screen is the main Navigational Menu which offers several tabs including Invoices, Orders, Vendor Chats, Support, PGP, Notifications, Shopping Cart, XMR Wallet, and Profile Settings.

Users can utilize the search function located above the tiled listings. This function offers both Simple Search and Advanced Search options.

In addition to these details, the ordering options section encompasses shipping options, order quantity, and bulk quantity settings. This is followed by product images, as well as buttons for contacting the vendor, reporting the listing, adding it to favorites, and adding it to the cart.

Once all the applicable listing options have been selected, users have the ability to press the "Add to cart" button. This allows them to either proceed with the immediate purchase of the product or add additional products to their cart. This convenient feature enables users to pay for multiple orders within a single transaction.

In order to engage with DrugHub staff members, users are required to utilize the valid PGP key associated with each staff member. This serves as an additional security measure enforced by DrugHub, ensuring that all communication takes place through PGP encryption.
